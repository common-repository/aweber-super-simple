AWeber Super Simple allows you to subscribe users to 
an AWeber autoresponder when they register
on your blog. NOTE: ALPHA VERSION.  Be careful.
It's a bit temperamental.



== Description ==


Aweber Super Simple is a plugin that will subscribe a user whenever
he/she registers to your blog. 


The AWeber Super Simple options page allows you to configure the plugin to:
* Choose whether or not to display the optin checkbox.  Users may register if optin isn't shown, and will not added to autoresponder. 
* Choose a checked or unchecked default status for the optin checkbox on registration.
* Provide a custom optin greeting message for visitors

This code base is at least once, possibly 3, 3 or more times removed from what was the original 
code base.  Wherever or whenever the ultimate source, the base code is *old* in WordPress years.
Current effort is to bring everything up to 2.8 coding standards before attempting any extensions.
